# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone** focused on analyzing Cyclistic's bike-share data to provide insights and marketing recommendations. The primary goal of the analysis is to understand how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently and to propose strategies that can help convert casual riders into annual members.

## Project Structure

The project follows the **6 phases of data analysis**: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act**.

### Folder Structure:
- **Data**: Contains the original datasets used in this project (`Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.xlsx` and `Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.xlsx`).
- **Scripts**: All R scripts that were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
- **Visualizations**: Includes all saved visualizations used in the analysis.
- **Reports**: Contains the final report and case study in both RMarkdown (`Cyclistic_Case_Study.Rmd`) and HTML format.
- **Output Data**: The cleaned and processed data used for analysis.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Business Task:
- Analyze the behavior of Cyclistic bike users to determine how annual members and casual riders differ in their bike usage.

### 2. Data Sources:
- Divvy bike-share datasets (2019 Q1 and 2020 Q1).

### 3. Analysis:
- Cleaning and processing data.
- Summarizing the average trip duration by user type.
- Analyzing the popularity of start and end stations.
- Visualizing the results in various forms (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps).

### 4. Visualizations:
- **Average Trip Duration** by user type (bar chart).
- **Distribution of Trips** by user type (pie chart).
- **Popularity of Start Stations** by user type (heatmap).
- **Bike Usage Trends Over Time** (line graph).

### 5. Key Findings:
- **Casual riders** tend to take longer trips compared to annual members.
- The majority of trips occur from popular start stations around the city.
- Bike usage peaks during weekends for casual riders, while members show more consistent usage patterns during weekdays.

### 6. Recommendations:
1. **Targeted Weekend Campaigns**: Focus on casual riders who use bikes on weekends and encourage membership by offering discounts or perks.
2. **Membership Drive for Commuters**: Promote annual memberships to casual riders who are using bikes for commuting during weekdays.
3. **Optimize Bike Availability**: Ensure a greater number of bikes are available at key start stations on weekends, when casual rider demand is highest.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository and open the R project.
2. Run the R scripts inside the **Scripts** folder to replicate the analysis.
3. Use the `Cyclistic_Case_Study.Rmd` inside the **Reports** folder to explore the full analysis and generate the report.
